# dart-practice
This is my very first dart project that is created and run successfully after many clearing obstacles.
Today, after looking for guidance over the internet for 2 days, I learned:
- How to install Dart SDK on PC.
- How to add Dart SDK to Environment Variables Path.
- How to install and setup VS Code to run Dart programs.
- How to integrate Git in VS Code terminal
I am happy that finally I have made a big step toward becoming a Flutter Developer!
